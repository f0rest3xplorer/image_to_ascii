# image_to_ascii

This is a basic project to convert .jpg and .png images to ascii art. It's still pretty rough and needs some features added and I need to clean things up, but it's funcitonal.

I followed the tutorial from (Robert Heaton)[https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/]
